# CO₂ Prediction in Steelmaking

This repository contains the source code and data used in the paper:
**"Low-cost, real-time CO₂ monitoring using interpretable machine learning in heavy industry"**

## Overview
The project explores multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.) to predict CO₂ emissions from steelmaking processes. Dimensionality was reduced from 7 to 3 key features while maintaining ~98% accuracy.
